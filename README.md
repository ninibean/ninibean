I am a computer science student and a creative. I am really interested in web development, UX/UI design, program management, and sooo much more.

I like to work in the interrection of art and technology! There is so many practical skills you learn in the creative process (even coding is creative in a way), and I plan on using the creative process in my work to leave a positive impact on the world!
