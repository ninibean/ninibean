💻 I am a technical program manager who's hopelessly fascinated with human-computer design (HCI). I see a unique opportunity to solve some of the world's most pressing socio-technical problem through HCI. Previously a software engineer, currently a mentor and student.

🎨 Working at the intersection of art and technology is what I live for. There is so many practical skills you learn in the creative process (even coding is creative in a way), and I plan on using the creative process in my work to leave a positive impact on the world!
